    Morgan starts narrating in a deep, charismatic voice. Ellie, Cassandra and Tom listen in anticipation.

      <h4>
        MORGAN
      </h4>
      After three weeks of travel, you finally see familiar green hills. You relax, knowing that the bridge is just on the other side. You can already hear the river.
    </div>
    The afternoon light fills the room as if they are outside. Sound of running water from a distance.
    <div className="indent">
      <h4>
        MORGAN (CONT'D)
      </h4>
      But the moment you climb up the hill, your smiles disappear.
    </div>
    A hollow wind starts blowing in the room. Concerned faces around the table.
    <div className="indent">
      <h4>
        MORGAN (CONT'D)
      </h4>
      The forest that surrounds the river has completely burned down. You stare at a land of black trees, charcoal and ashes.
    </div>
    A strong, red light falls on the table and the players. Ellie leans back.
    <div className="indent">
      <h4>
        MORGAN (CONT'D)
      </h4>
      The bridge is mostly burned, but still intact. It looks barebones. An ominous sight.
    </div>

    <div className="indent">
      <h4>
        TOM
      </h4>
      We go towards the bridge. I'm in the front, weapon drawn. Serena, you have your spells ready yeah?
    </div>
    She nods. Ellie pretends to take her weapon out. Morgan moves their tokens closer to the bridge on the battle map.
